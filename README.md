# Text-Snipper
This plugin allows you to specify in the settings page a CSS class, and then looks for any elements that contain it and trims the text down so that it does not overflow its height. This is for vertical trimming of multi-line text. The plugin is rather simple at the moment, but expect updates in the not to far future.
